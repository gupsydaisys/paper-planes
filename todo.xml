ADD ONS
0. CREATE GOOD animation/whatever for plane button in organizer.
1. alert view needs some altering visually (look at fb photo)
2. should you be alterted if...
....a) have shit in post comment field and then click away which would consequently delete the currently selected box
....b) click x to exit feedback view should alert if there exists at least one dotbox with at least 1 comment
....c) if you x a dotbox that has a comment then should you be alerted
3. buttons colors. remains blue photo button if touch and drag outside, instead of turning blue, graying out or enlarging or wiggling

FUTURE ADD ONS
- create bounds around the buttons
- figure out a better button then the x for exit button feedback mode
- don't have overlapping dotboxes

Future Testing
0. Do we need more of a way to look at the overview of everything you have done?
1. Should you add a box when you dismiss tutorial alert?
2. Should you create bounds around the buttons?
3. "tap where you want feedback" how does this feel? >>>>

(Pieter and co)
People don't know you can leave boxes (not dots or something)
and that you can do this multiple places

4. Is is strange that a box is added when you zoom in/out?
5. Is it strange that when you click on feeditem in organizer that that view doesn't have tutorialalert?

FUTURE FUTURE ADD ONS:
- flash
- focus
- filters
- rotation
- mark as complete
