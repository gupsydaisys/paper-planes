OPEN QUESTIONS
1. Organizer
- documents one after each other in organizer will look too similar and be hard to distinguish if they are the same
2. What is the best way to mark homework?
- handles getting clumsy for dotboxes
- kind of wihs she coudl drag over the region
- wanted to highlight soemthing within region
- highlight and draw

ORGANIZER
1. Easy to distinguish a piece of work: grp associated, picture of it, creator
2. Easy to see if it's been updated since you last viewed it










Wed get Charles
Wed get Casie & Marina

Ongoing:
- use it with girl
- find 2 people in the same class

QUESTION TO ASK DURING TESTING
0. Do we need more of a way to look at the overview of everything you have done?
1. "tap where you want feedback" how does this feel? >>>>
-> coding excersise didn't make sense with this message

(Pieter and co)
People don't know you can leave boxes (not dots or something)
and that you can do this multiple places

2. Should it be more explicit to dimiss keyboard?








SERENA
0. mess around with styling for post comment container
1. table handle top should be changing arrow

1. animate post field
2. change to instagram like view on feed
3. change so you can also bring keyboard up using swipe gesture
4. after a user as put feedback in once, change message to "add more feedback here..."
5. show all comments after posting a new comment
...
20. change both request and add feedback to look the same
(get Hani input on animation + colors)

HANI FUTURE
1. shouldn't be able to put box handles off screen
2. don't allow the dotbox to resize and have the icons switch around
3. no overlapping dotboxes
4. create bounds around icons on feedpack page so you can't put dotbox there


MOST IMPORTANT CHANGES
1. need to make send button more button looking
>> box buttons bigger than send button (EVERYONE)
>> add a drop shadow
>> animate object
2. change swipe gesture recognizer on organizer to swipe to correct view and swipe on navigation should swipe to last selected view or not do anything
3. should you be alterted if...
....a) have shit in post comment field and then click away which would consequently delete the currently selected box
....b) click x to exit feedback view should alert if there exists at least one dotbox with at least 1 comment
....c) if you x a dotbox that has a comment then should you be alerted
....e) if you spend time resizing and moving dotbox the should be alerted if you delete it
4. you should add a dotbox when you dimiss tutorial alert


VISUAL CHANGES
0. whenever you add a new sheet by clicking plane button, have organizer very obviously add it or show changes.
1. alert view needs some altering visually (look at fb photo)
2. buttons colors. remains blue photo button if touch and drag outside, instead of turning blue, graying out or enlarging or wiggling
3. figure out a better button then the x for exit button feedback mode

BUGS
0. have to many times tap twice on the camera
1. double tap should not leave dotbox
2. touch down on white x and then move finger away (but dont' lift up), it one time froze the swipe to other pages features and in general doesn't unselect.

FUTURE ADD-ONS
- flash
- focus
- filters for hw
- rotation
- mark different items in organizer as complete












HARD BUGS
1. Doesn't seem like it's caused by the tranistion method in PageViewController since when you try to catch it, nothing is logged.
- tried limiting clicks
- tried having a boolean
- tried dispatching it asychronously to the main queue
