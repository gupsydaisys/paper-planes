To do tommorrow:
<!-- 1. delete when you add a dotbox without a comment  -->
<!-- 2. double tap zooms out.
 --><!-- 3. what to do with unselected dotboxes
 -->

BUGS
1. remains blue photo button if touch and drag outside

ADD ONS
1. alert view needs some altering visually
2. should you be alterted if...
....a) have shit in post comment field and then click away which would consequently delete the currently selected box
....b) click x to exit feedback view should alert if there exists at least one dotbox with at least 1 comment
....c) if you x a dotbox that has a comment then should you be alerted



FUTURE ADD ONS
- create bounds around the buttons
- figure out a better button then the x for exit button feedback mode
- don't have overlapping dotboxes

Future Testing
0. Do we need more of a way to look at the overview of everything you have done?
1. Should you add a box when you dismiss tutorial alert?
2. Should you create bounds around the buttons?
3. "tap where you want feedback" how does this feel? >>>>

(Pieter and co)
People don't know you can leave boxes (not dots or something)
and that you can do this multiple places

4. Is is strange that a box is added when you zoom in/out?

FUTURE FUTURE ADD ONS:
- flash
- focus
- filters
- rotation
