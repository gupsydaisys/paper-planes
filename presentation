Initial Presentation
We’re developing an app to allow students to give each other feedback and help.

Here’s how it works:

Image you come across this question while doing a problem set for a class:
{Insert picture of difficult math 104 question}

Suppose you talked through the problem with a friend a bit at Cafe Milano or you have a general idea of where the problem is going or you have 0 idea where to begin.

Our app is there for you.

You snap a picture of the problem and/or your incomplete proof.  And mark exactly where you want feedback.  Whether it’s on all of it or just a part of it. {demonstrate using dot boxes}

You send it off to your friend who can help you or just ask more questions.

Feedback has been shown time again to be the crux 


It’s about creating a easy way to get help remotely from your friends.  Creating a network.

In the fall, we're launching with a professor and well see how it goes from there!

TRICKY QUESTIONS
1) Cheating?
- People already cheat can continue to do so via gmail text messages
- people cheat when they don’t have the necessary support or feel stressed out.  this is supposed to remove that stress
- empowering people to give each other feedback has only been shown to have positive effects.
- cheating is generally the fault of the system
We don't condone cheating.  We understand that this app could be used for plagiarism but there already a multitude of different venues for cheating.  Gmail can be used to relay illegal information however no one would argue that gmail shouldn't' exist.  Gmail has intrinsic value that it adds etc.  Name other apps as well if necessary.  We believe the root cause for cheating is summative assessment and our goal is to remove as much summative assessment as possible and facilitate a productive environment based around formative assessment.

2) What’s the different between this and moodle or piazza?
- student collaboration that is don’t remotely,  this doesn’t have anything to do with teachers
- hopefully teachers would endorse it (Like alex) and then we can get entire classes to sign up

3) How does this compare to Facebook groups?
- Facebook groups aren’t use for 2-3 people who are collobraoting.  It’s just difficult to share work.
- get distracted by Facebook on your computer

4) If the technology is easy to duplicate, what is your value add?
- not necessarily true, it’s pretty difficult often times coming up with a good UI
- our value add would be creating a great platform and network that is really simple, cross-device and effective
